## Problem statement :
As a colorado resident and a mother of freshman , I was interested in finding out the mystery of why there was a sudden 
sharp rise in SAT scored in the state of Coorado from 2017 to 2018.


## overview of  project  
This project is  roughly devided in 4 sections
1. Importing the ACT and  SAT data from 2017  and 18
The data sets has particiation data and the score data for years 2017 and 2018 for all 51 states  in United states.

2. cleaning the data and renaming columns appropriately
3. Merging the two data set
4. Exploratory analysis to find trends and intersting information


## Concusion  
I was able to determine the cause of it upon further research on the college board website of Colorado at 
[]!(https://www.cde.state.co.us/assessment/coloradosat)

The  old SAT  had not kept up and was really outdated.
College board  the owner of SAT has Revamped in 2006  to be more aligned with the current curriculum and what students learnt in high school.
The College Board has partnered with online education provider Khan AcademyÂ® to provide free online SAT practice to all students.
Lastly , partnership with schools around country so that students can take the test free.

Due to above reasons the SAT participation is coloado went to 100% in 2018 from 11 percent from the prior year.
